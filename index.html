            <h4>Introduction</h4>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key progress in the patient safety movement in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has
            been the call for a common language - a taxonomy - for categorizing medical events. The concept of a
            taxonomy combines terminology and the science of classification - in the case of patient safety, the
            Identification and classification of things that go wrong in health care, the causes why they occur, and the
            preventive approaches that can minimize their reoccurrence.<br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saudi Patient Safety Taxonomy was published in 2018, a comprehensive
            standard classification on patient safety events providing a structure for organizing information to be used
            for many purposes, including national statistics, descriptive studies, and evaluative research.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>The purpose for developing a National Patient Safety Taxonomy</h4>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the national classification for Patient Safety is to enable
                the categorization of patient safety information using standardized sets of concepts with agreed
                definitions, preferred terms, and the relationships between them. Furthermore, the Saudi Patient Safety
                classification has been designed to be genuine conjunction of national perceptions of the main issues
                related to patient safety and to facilitate the development of reliable organization - based, regional
                and national event reporting systems allowing for description, comparison, measurement, monitoring,
                analysis, and interpretation of information to improve patient care and its related policies. As a
                result, will enable setting up priorities in best practices in terms of patient safety and quality
                improvement initiatives.</p>

            <h4>The value of a Patient Safety Taxonomy</h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presenting a unified and coherent structure for event reporting in Saudi
                Arabia through a working taxonomy conveys the message that the healthcare Sector will maintain a
                singular focus on the national detection, capture, analysis, and reporting of all aspects of medical
                events. Structuring patient safety information and sharing it in a structured way can support a deeper
                understanding of things that go wrong in health care, which could lead to the implementation of positive
                actions in a consistent fashion. It provides an infrastructure that will support the development of
                specific modules to address emerging patient safety concerns and facility-specific or regional
                interests. Moreover, standardized definitions found in the taxonomy are required to develop better
                quantitative and qualitative measures in patient safety. The Saudi Patient Safety Taxonomy could serve
                as a 'learning point' for developing countries that are falling behind to join the patient safety
                movement.</p>
